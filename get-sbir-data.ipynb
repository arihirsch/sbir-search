      "('A254-002', 1220, 'Explosive Ordnance Disposal Visual Ordnance Identification Database (EODVOID)', 'ARMY', 'OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Trusted AI and Autonomy; Advanced Computing and Software\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: The Explosive Ordnance Disposal Visual Ordnance Identification Database (EODVOID) will develop an automated photogrammetry method to greatly increase the speed of scanning and creating 3D models for 1000’s of pieces of ordnance samples. This would enable the development of a much-needed authoritative ordnance database and serve as a baseline standard for training and developing AI/ML detection and classification algorithms.\\n\\nDESCRIPTION: Currently there is no Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) based ordnance detection/identification/recognition technology available to Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Soldiers. Such a technology would greatly assist in the detection and identification of these ordnance items and potentially increase the safety of EOD personnel. EOD technicians have rendered safe over 100,000 improvised explosive devices in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2006 and have trained thousands of host nation forces. To effectively execute their mission, EOD Technicians typically identify ordnance by physical sight or through analyzing images from fielded robotic platforms (ground or air). Currently all identification of ordnance is done visually and relies on the expertise of EOD operators, that typically utilize printed reference materials which include photographs and line drawings of the potential explosive hazards. The problem of identifying threats is further complicated by the fact that there are tens of thousands of different types of threat items worldwide, and some may be made to appear like other ordnance but functions differently. To add to the issue, once ordnance is fired, the physical characteristics (shape) may change and key identifying features such as markings may be altered or destroyed. If ordnance has been left in certain environments for extended periods of time, there may be a significant degradation to the appearance of the item due to rust and damage. Once the ordinance is properly identified, the EOD Technician can proceed to the next phase of their mission.\\n\\nThe EODVOID will utilize photogrammetry methods developed by this SBIR and have cameras mounted on a robot to capture high resolution files of ordnance and their components. We will develop an automated system that will scan, take photos and create 3D models in one complete action. Once captured these images will be stored, along with all the metadata of each item, in a database with the ability to be geographically tailored to subset databases for any regional deployment.  It is extremely important to have hi-resolution images for the purpose of training the CV algorithms. We will be generating (NOT SIMULATING) hi-resolution images that have been aged, rusted, dented, broken and placed in different environments as well as all aspect angles of the ordnance.\\n\\nPHASE I: This topic is only accepting Direct to Phase II proposals for a cost up to $2,000,000 for a 24-month period of performance. \\n\\nProposers interested in submitting a DP2 proposal must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility equivalent to a Phase I project has been met. Documentation can include data, reports, specific measurements, success criteria of a prototype, etc.\\n\\n(DIRECT TO) PHASE II: Companies are expected to develop a fully automated photogrammetry scanning program for ordnance to create 3D models that can be populated into a database. \\n\\nThis SBIR proposal will create a controlled automated environment, using high end DSL cameras, computers, turntables and proper lighting, this will ensure all the shadowing and detail on the ordnance is correct. Because of this process we will be able to generate (NOT SIMULATE) hi-resolution 3D images as well as age, dent, rust, brake apart items and show what actual fired ordnance would look like on the battlefield. Being able to create this process will make it extremely faster and more comprehensive for the purpose of training the CV algorithms.\\n\\nThis proposal will leverage highly mature computer vision approaches that have not previously been applied to EOD applications. Once the process to establish a database has been created, transfer learning methods will be employed as a first step towards achieving the required level of detection and classification.  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are currently integrated as an important tool within the industrial base and have automated image and video recognition tasks, resulting in a high degree of effectiveness and efficiency across multiple sectors. For example, CNNs are now integrated in a variety of industries, to include retail, automotive, healthcare and manufacturing. CNNs can be used in medical imaging applications and in manufacturing for monitoring and ensuring quality. Automotive manufacturers use related methods for the design of autopilot capabilities and autonomous driving applications. The development of the EODVOID and corresponding metadata standard for training deep learning algorithms is fundamental to the development of AI/ML detection algorithms. The primary enabling technology for the autonomous recognition of ordnance is an automated scanning solution to populate the database.  Such technology has been proven to a TRL 6 at Picatinny Arsenal and the DEVCOM AC EOD in 2024. \\n\\nCompanies must have extensive knowledge on photogrammetry methods and related automation software.

      "('A254-005', 1220, 'Automated Course of Action Generation', 'ARMY', 'OUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Trusted AI and Autonomy; Advanced Computing and Software\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: Automated Course of Action (CoA) recommendation at the Unit of Action. Currently, it takes units at the Battalion (BN) echelon several hours to use the Military Decision-Making Process (MDMP) to generate and vet CoA options. Leveraging state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) algorithms will speed up this process by an order of magnitude, allowing systematic replanning during the execution phase of operations. This will improve mission success and reduce risk to force in combat operations. It will also enable the mobile, distributed command post concept.\\n\\nDESCRIPTION: Several approaches to CoA generation for military applications currently exist. These methods leverage large language models (LLM) applied to Doctrine (ARL’s COA-GPT, AI2C’s Camo-GPT, IBM’s Watson-X, Scale AI’s Donovan) or deep learning/hierarchical modeling applied to wargaming (ARL’s STRONG, Stilman Solutions’ LG-RAID, DARPA SCEPTER). Each existing LLM approach is inadequate for CoA generation at BN due to lack of proper consideration of Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for both friendly and enemy forces. The existing learned/hierarchical approaches that depend on wargaming are also inadequate due to a lack of fully automated wargaming capability at the BN echelon and/or due to CoA outcomes that are not aligned with best practices (TTPs and SOPs). Proposals submitted under this topic will leverage state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches to create a CoA recommendation module narrowly tailored to the BN echelon. This capability will expand to encompass higher echelons in later phases.\\n\\nPHASE I: This topic is only accepting Phase I proposals for a cost up to $250,000 for a 6-month period of performance.\\u202f\\n\\nUnderstand relevant scenarios and data sources. Design development strategy. Conduct feasibility study. Develop and demonstrate proof-of-concept CoA recommendation algorithm.\\n\\n PHASE II: Develop and train CoA recommendation agent and support integration into appropriate mission command system. Make interim algorithm deliveries biannually for independent evaluation. Deliver final algorithm, supporting software, documentation and algorithm performance report.\\n\\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Automated CoA generation has wide applicability to autonomous systems in industries such as robotics, self-driving automobiles, security, and gaming.\\n•\\tFinancial Services & Personal Finance: Aides in professional, financial services planning and “gamming” out as well as planning for things like retirement and estates. \\n•\\tRetail and Supply Chain: These models can help ensure that supply chains aren’t strained for retail products (can also work for B2B solutions). \\n•\\tConstruction & Manufacturing: AI models can assist in project planning and forecast unforeseen problems\\n•\\tHealthcare: Aides in personal healthcare forecasting and preventative medicine  \\n\\nREFERENCES:\\n1.\\thttps://deepmind.google/technologies/alphazero-and-muzero/\\n2.\\thttps://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphastar-mastering-the-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/\\n3.\\thttps://openai.com/index/emergent-tool-use/\\n \\nKEYWORDS: Autonomy; AI/ML; Course of Action; Command and Control; Multi-agent\\n...', 'https://www.sbir.gov/topics/11366', '2024/11/06', '2025/01/08')\n",
